The Flex and Rails 3 applications work with Ruby 1.9.2 and Rails 3.0.3.

1. For the rails app, modify db settings, create, migrate and seed the development database. That should be good to go.

2. In the app\flex\Main.mxml file, modify _remoteObject.endpoint in "onComplete()" method as necessary and compile the
   flex app.

3. Run the flex app. Click 'Update" to update the record.

Note: At the time of this demo release, there is a bug in awesome-nested-set that has a monkey patch in this app.
      If you try to rebuild from scratch and install the plugins, you will have an error that you will have to patch.

Also: There is a clear.sql script in the db folder of the rails app that you can use to quickly clear the database.
